# Docker Lab: Names

Previously in the lab...

Question: Where do these strange names come from?

Answer: Docker (what a surprise!)... Beside the CONTAINER_ID the NAME is a unique identifier for a container.

## Naming a Container

Unlike the CONTAINER_ID the NAME is something we can manipulate. The name is handy not only for starting/connecting/stopping/destroying a container but also for the networking (which comes later in the lab).

To do so you have to add a parameter in the `run` command of Docker

`docker run --name mariadb-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb`

As always, to check if this has really worked out look at the container list

```bash
$ docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
6f08ac657320        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   58 seconds ago      Up 57 seconds       3306/tcp            mariadb-container
699e82ed8f1f        mariadb             "docker-entrypoint..."   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       3306/tcp            jolly_bardeen
```

If you want to access your DB server there are two ways:

1) Using `docker exec -it mariadb-container bash`
   This will connect you into the remote `bash` shell from where you can connect to the server via `mysql -uroot -pmy-secret-pw`.

1) Using a local mysql client
   This is a bit tricky. First you have to find out the IP address of your docker container. Therefore use this command:

```bash
$ docker inspect mariadb-container
[
    {
        "Id": "6f08ac657320f279a9193728905f6f18d74f72d2c5dea97a9ffc76fb7e216c59",

        "Path": "docker-entrypoint.sh",
        "Args": [
            "mysqld"
        ],

                    "IPv6Gateway": "",

                    "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
                    "DriverOpts": null
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

In the last section (`NetworkSettings`) you will find the `IPAddress` for your container. In this example it's 172.17.0.2.
Once you have the IP you can connect with the command `mysql -h172.17.0.2 -uroot -p` (use password from run command)

The above command did not work on Windows/Powershell: `ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on '172.17.0.2' (10060)`
Alternative on Windows/Powershell: Start the container with a port mapping:
`docker run --name mariadb-container -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -d mariadb`
Connect with:
`.\mysql --host=localhost --port=3306 -uroot -pmy-secret-pw`

**Note:** The mysql client must be installed on your computer. On Windows, you can use the binary from the ZIP archive at <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>.

Question: Hmm, I have a container with a DB Server running... But when I remove the container what is happening with my data?

Let's find out in... the next lab!
